## Guidelines for Ambiguous Cases

In situations where posts contain elements of multiple categories or are unclear about their categorization, employ the following guidelines:

- **Prioritizing Urgency:** If a post implies immediate danger or severe distress, categorize it as an 'Immediate Crisis' regardless of the presence of other elements.
- **Consider Context:** Evaluate the post's overall context and determine which category the post is more closely aligned with.    
- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** As more posts are categorized, your understanding of each category will evolve. Re-evaluate previous categorizations and adjust as necessary. Remember that your main objective is to support individuals based on their unique needs effectively. Thus, these categories may be updated during the project's active learning stage.
- **Avoid Assumptions:** Do not make assumptions about what the poster is experiencing based on limited information. Instead, focus on the post's content and the language used by the poster to guide categorization. If a post is vague and does not provide enough information for accurate categorization, it may be best to leave it uncategorized or marked for further review once more information is available.

## Recognizing Patterns and Trends

It might be advantageous to note recurring themes, trends, or common phrases appearing in certain categories throughout the categorization process. This practice might streamline the categorization process by identifying patterns and providing deeper insights, contributing to refining the categorization criteria. It encourages a more adaptive and dynamic approach, enhancing the overall project's effectiveness.
