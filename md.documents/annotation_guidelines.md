### Guidelines for Ambiguous Cases
There may be instances where certain posts appear to encompass elements that align with multiple categories or do not straightforwardly belong to a particular category. In such instances, the following guidelines should be employed:
- **Emphasising Urgency:** In the event that a post contains any indications of immediate distress or danger, it should be categorised as a crisis, even if it simultaneously incorporates elements of struggle, recovery/management, or advice/support. The immediate safety and mental wellbeing of the individual is of utmost importance.
- **Contextual Considerations:** The overall context of the post should be a significant factor. If advice is being sought, but the post contains substantial elements of emotional distress, it may be more appropriate to categorise it under struggling rather than advice/support. Conversely, if there is the expression of emotional turmoil alongside discussions of active coping strategies, categorisation under recovery/management may be more fitting.
- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** As more posts are categorised, a more nuanced understanding of each category will be developed. Re-evaluation of previous categorisations and making necessary adjustments as comprehension evolves is a critical part of the process. The ultimate objective is to accurately and effectively support individuals based on their particular needs - these catergories may be updated during the active learning stage of this project.
- **Avoiding Assumptions:** Assumptions should not be made about what the poster is experiencing based on limited information. The focus should be on the content of the post and the language utilised by the poster to guide categorisation. In cases where a post is vague and does not provide enough information for an accurate categorisation, it may be advisable to leave it uncategorised or noted for further review once additional information is made available.

### Noting Patterns and Trends
Throughout the categorisation process, it could prove advantageous to keep a record of recurring themes or trends. This could involve noting common expressions or phrases that frequently appear in certain categories, or identifying common characteristics of posts that are often categorised together. Such observations might not only streamline the categorisation process by highlighting patterns, but also provide deeper insights that could contribute to the refinement of the categorisation criteria. This practice advocates for a more adaptive and dynamic approach, improving the overall effectiveness of the project.
