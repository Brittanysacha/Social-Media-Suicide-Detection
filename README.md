# Social-Media-Suicide-Detection
Leveraging NLP to identify suicidal ideation on social media, extracting insights into user well-being for application in clinical research.

### Subreddit Selection
The selected subreddits encompass a wide range of mental health conditions, from anxiety and depression to more specific conditions like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and eating disorders. This broad selection allows for a comprehensive exploration of language patterns associated with diverse mental health experiences. Moreover, these subreddits are known for their active communities and open discussions about personal struggles, which makes them valuable sources of authentic, self-reported data on mental health, including instances of suicidal ideation.

### Classifacation Catergories
In the endeavor to analyse mental health discussions on Reddit, a machine learning model will be developed to classify posts into four primary categories. These categories aim to capture the range of experiences and emotions expressed by users in these communities, from times of severe crisis to the stages of recovery and management, as well as the offering of advice or support. Here's a breakdown of these categories:

- **Crisis:** This category would include posts indicating severe distress, including suicidal ideation, self-harm, or other urgent mental health crises.

- **Struggling:** These posts might not express an immediate crisis but show the individual is experiencing distress or difficulty, such as struggling with symptoms, facing challenges in their personal life, or feeling particularly down or anxious.

- **Recovery/Management:** This category could include posts discussing ongoing recovery from a past crisis, management of mental health conditions, or positive changes and improvements.

- **Support/Advice:** These posts may provide advice, coping strategies, or support to others, or discuss mental health topics more generally.
